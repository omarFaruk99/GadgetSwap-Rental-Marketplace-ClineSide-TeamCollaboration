// Limitations ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This component will not receive any params.

Use all your creativity to make it uniquely beautiful with clean minimalistic slik design. Don't install/import/use Shadcn, but make the design looks like shadcn.

Make it container-sized maximum width. Do not use Next.js. Use only React and TailwindCSS. Don't use any raw CSS, inline CSS or style attribute. Give me the code in .jsx file.

All necessary icons you can take from React-icons. You may use colours only on icons. Not svg icon. Also correct the image sizes using TailwindCSS not Query Parameters.

Create a state called 'darkMode'. If can be true or false. While using colors, use both colors for dark and light mode.

Make it fully responsive for all devices. Use breakpoints mentioned in TailwindCSS. Avoid writing unnecessary hooks. If the screen size comes below the breakpoing lg, show up the collapsed menu button.

And avoid writing any function inside return. Better to write all functions above the return and use functions inside return.

After writing the code, no need to write any explanation. Only code in component is alright.

Learning Redux ---
Run this command to install necessary packages [npm install @reduxjs/toolkit]. Using this toolkit working with redux will be easy.
Run this command to install necessary packages [npm install react-redux]. This will connect the React the redux together.
'Features/darkLightTheme' is created under the 'src' directory.
'darkLightThemeSlice.js' is created under this 'Features/darkLightTheme' directory. And have written necessary code there.
'reduxStore.jsx' is created under this 'Providers' directory. And have written necessary code there.
Wrapped the whole project using a redux given Provider along with the reduxStore in the main.jsx file.
And the applied the states and action creator functions inside all relevant components using useSelector and useDispatch hook.
